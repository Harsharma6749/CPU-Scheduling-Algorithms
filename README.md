# CPU Scheduling Algorithms – OS Based Tool

## 📌 Overview
This project implements and compares **multiple CPU scheduling algorithms**.  
It calculates and displays important performance metrics such as:
- **Waiting Time**
- **Turnaround Time**
- **Response Time**

It is a core Operating System concept often asked in technical interviews.
